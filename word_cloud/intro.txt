Hey! I am Wentao, a computer science student at Yale-NUS College, the leading liberal arts college in Asia. There, I was able to take classes across disciplines and academic traditions, which helped me become a more methodical thinker, learner and communicator.

I grew up in Xuchang and moved to the provincial capital Zhengzhou when I was 12. At age 15, I boarded my first international flight and moved to the little red dot with the generous support of Singapore’s Ministry of Education.

I will be applying for master’s programs in data science/machine learning in 2024.

Check out what projects I have been up to! Also, here is a surprisingly accurate pronunciation of my name if you are having trouble.
