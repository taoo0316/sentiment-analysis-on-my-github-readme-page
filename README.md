# sentiment-analysis-on-my-github-readme-page

A small project that helps me dip my toes in NLP. Using the nltk package, this project aims to conduct sentiment analysis on my GitHub introduction page.
This is done using the pretrained sentiment analyzer called VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner).
